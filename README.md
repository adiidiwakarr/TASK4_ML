##DESCRIPTION:
This project implements a movie recommender system using the Surprise library with the built-in MovieLens 100k dataset. It follows these steps:

1. Importing Libraries: Uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and surprise for modeling and evaluation.


2. Data Loading: Loads the MovieLens 100k dataset.


3. Modeling: Applies SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) for collaborative filtering.


4. Training & Evaluation: Splits data into training and testing sets and evaluates using RMSE and MAE.


5. Recommendation Generation: Computes Top-N movie recommendations for each user.


6. Streamlit App: A simple UI built with Streamlit lets users select a user ID and view their top 5 movie recommendations with predicted ratings.
 USE :streamlit run TASK4.PY in terminal to run in app
